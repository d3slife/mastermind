# Mastermind - console interactive game
This game is a part of a larger project which is called [TheOdinProject.com](https://www.theodinproject.com).
The main idea behind this task is to develop stronger understanding of classes, objects and overall connections between them. Thought, I'm not really aware of different desing patterns which are actually used in software development in real life.
